Subject: [PATCH 14/27] x86/pkeys: Don't check if PKRU is zero before writting
 it

write_pkru() checks if the current value is the same as the expected
value. So instead just checking if the current and new value is zero
(and skip the write in such a case) we can benefit from that.

Remove the zero check of PKRU, write_pkru() provides a similar check.
