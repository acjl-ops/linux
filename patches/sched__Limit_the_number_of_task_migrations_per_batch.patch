Subject: sched: Limit the number of task migrations per batch on RT
From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
Date: Mon Jun  6 12:12:51 2011 +0200

Batched task migrations are a source for large latencies as they keep the
scheduler from running while processing the migrations.

Limit the batch size to 8 instead of 32 when running on a RT enabled
kernel.
