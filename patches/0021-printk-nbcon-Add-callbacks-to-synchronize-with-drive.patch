Subject: [PATCH 21/57] printk: nbcon: Add callbacks to synchronize with driver

Console drivers typically must deal with access to the hardware
via user input/output (such as an interactive login shell) and
output of kernel messages via printk() calls.

Follow-up commits require that the printk subsystem is able to
synchronize with the driver. Require nbcon consoles to implement
two new callbacks (device_lock(), device_unlock()) that will
use whatever synchronization mechanism the driver is using for
itself (for example, the port lock for uart serial consoles).

+	 * MUST also disable migration. The console driver may be using a

+	 * spinlocks). Otherwise this function must explicitly call
+	 * migrate_disable().
+	 *
+	 * The flags argument is provided as a convenience to the driver. It

+	 * if the driver does not need it.
