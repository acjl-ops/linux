Subject: [PATCH 095/122] printk: nbcon: Explicitly release ownership on failed
 emit

Until now it was assumed that ownership has been lost when the
write_atomic() callback fails. nbcon_emit_next_record() only
returns false when ownership has been lost. So explicitly
release ownership if write_atomic() fails to be sure.
